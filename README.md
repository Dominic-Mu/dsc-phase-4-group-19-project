## Project Overview
There are 1120 photographs in the dataset, evenly split into two classes: 560 images show smokers, and the remaining 560 images show non-smokers, or those who do not smoke. The dataset is curated by repeatedly entering terms such as "person," "smoker," "cigarette smoker," "coughing," "taking inhaler," "person on the phone," "drinking water," and so on into different search engines.


## Business Problem
This project aims to curb smoking rates in urban areas. The challenge is to develop an effective, technology-driven solution for automated smoking detection in public spaces. By leveraging deep learning algorithms on surveillance cameras, the organization seeks to identify and monitor instances of smoking in real-time. The objective is to implement a system that not only enforces no-smoking policies but also provides valuable data for targeted anti-smoking campaigns and public health intervention.
