## Project Overview
In the realm of outdoor environment analysis, accurate weather recognition from still images plays a pivotal role in diverse applications. The challenge at hand is to harness the potential of the Multi-class Weather Dataset (MWD), a rich collection of images designed for multi-class weather recognition.

The business objective is to leverage the MWD to advance the development of image classification models capable of accurately recognizing and categorizing different weather conditions. By doing so, this project aims to enhance the capabilities of outdoor weather analysis, offering valuable insights for sectors ranging from transportation and agriculture to urban planning and disaster preparedness.
