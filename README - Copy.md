## Project Overview
Bike sharing systems are bicycle rental services wherein a city's network of kiosk locations automates the membership, rental, and return of bicycle processes. Individuals can borrow a bike from one spot and return it to another as needed by using these services. There are already more than 500 bike-sharing initiatives operating globally.
Because the length of the trip, the starting point, the destination, and the amount of time that has passed are all openly recorded, these systems create data that is useful for research.  As a result, bike sharing programs operate as a sensor network that may be utilized to research urban mobility. In order to predict the demand for bike rentals in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C., competitors are required to integrate meteorological data with prior usage patterns.
